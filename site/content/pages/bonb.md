The last Friday of every month Shift volunteers serve breakfast to bicyclists on the Steel, Flanders, Blumenauer and Tillikum bridges. Many bike commuters have come to look forward to hot coffee and delicious pastries on their way to work once a month - and you can't beat the views! Note, we generally arrive on the bridges around 7:00 a.m. and stay till 9:00. 

Join us for this fun, community-building event. Stop by on your way to work, school, shopping, or where-ever you and your bike are going.

### BonB has a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/bonbpdx/), [Mastodon account](https://social.ridetrans.it/@bonbpdx), [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/bonbpdx), and [some pictures on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/bonb/).

## Volunteers

BonB is brought to you by a team of bike-fun-loving morning people (and those of us who drink enough coffee to resemble morning people). It takes many hands and much energy to deliver breakfast to so many cyclists in the morning and we love to share the work load opportunity to spread joy. There's much brewing, baking, and donation retrieval to be done, but if you're not the type who plans ahead just show up and put your friendly smile to use- we always enjoy company on the bridges! If you're interested in helping out, get in touch with [our volunteers](mailto:bonb@lists.riseup.net).

BonB is planned and organized through the occasional meeting and plenty of electronic correspondence through [the BonB mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/bonb). Maybe handing out breakfast before the sun comes up isn't your thing? We're always looking for friendly and creative folks to help find donors, pick up and drop off donations, and promote BonB via creative signs and feeding logistics.

## Schedule

Breakfast on the Bridges happens **7:00 - 9:00 am on the last Friday of every month**. Well... pretty much. At the end of the year, both BonB's land near major holidays, so we place the Thanksgiving and Christmas BonB events near St Lucia's day, Dec 13th.

## Current Locations

We have four regular serving locations as of 2023:

1. **Steel Bridge**: Team Steel sets up just East of the entrance to the lower bike/ped path (north end of the Eastbank Esplanade). Great views of the river and downtown skyline. 
2. **Tillikum Bridge**:  Team Tillikum sets up on the West side of the bridge, under the Red Balloons statue at the junction of S Bond Ave Multi-Use Path and the Bridge.
3. **Blumenauer Bridge**: Team Blumenauer stations on the North end of the bridge. Now that the Hawthorne Bridge crew has relocated to the Blumenauer Bridge, all 4 BonB locations are car-free!
4. **Flanders Crossing**: Expanding to four bridges for the first time! Say hi-diddly-ho to your bikey neighbors on one of the city's newest car-free bridges. 

## Donors

Free breakfast doesn't grow on trees! Unless it's fruit... We're happy to have the support of several local coffee and pastry shops as well as other food donors. And we're always looking for more!

## Other

Tardy slips are often available for those who are running late. They may not get you out of trouble, but they'll probably lighten the mood. At least you wont be trying to explain yourself on an empty stomach. 

BonB Superhero trading cards (on hand at special times) are a popular collectible commodity. You can expect them to triple in value over the next ten years. A whole set may someday go for eight times its original value at auction.
