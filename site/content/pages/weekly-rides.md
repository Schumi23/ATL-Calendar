Any day of the week is a good day for bike fun! Many groups have regularly-scheduled rides that happen on a specific day of the week. Some of these happen every week, or every other; all of the ones listed here happen at least once a month.

This is just a sample — there are also plenty of one-off or less-frequent rides beyond these. Check the [calendar](https://www.shift2bikes.org/calendar/) for the latest. If you host a regularly-scheduled ride and would like to see it listed here, please [contact us](https://www.shift2bikes.org/pages/contact/).
