## Want to connect with ATL?

ATL is run by folks off the cuff of our seats. I don't no anything about this.

* [Check out our code on GitHub](https://github.com/shift-org) - I borrowed it from shift2bikes!
* [Join us for a ride](/calendar/) or [post one of your own](/addevent/) — for free!

## Interested in connecting with a group who posts to the our calendar?

Reach out to the ride organizers using the contact information on their ride posting. Some prominent event organizers are listed here: 

* [M](mailto:pedalpalooza@gmail.com)WRATL
* Atlanta Social Rides
* Dope Pedalers
* Mobile Social
* Etc.

People who post events on our calendar can choose to make their contact information public, or not. If the organizers of an event chose to keep their contact info private, we can't share their contact info without their permission. However, if you contact the us, we can forward a message to them. If they're interested, they'll be in touch with you.
