## About

The [Midnight Mystery Ride](https://midnightmysteryride.wordpress.com/) has been riding monthly since 2002 on the 2nd Friday of the month. 

The ride start location is kept secret until the day of the event. Meet up around 11pm at the start location, then ride off at the stroke of midnight to a destination known only to your friendly ride leader. 

For more info, check out their [info & tips](https://midnightmysteryride.wordpress.com/about), and a long list of [past rides](https://midnightmysteryride.wordpress.com/). Contact Team Midnight at [midnightmysteryridePDX@gmail.com](mailto:midnightmysteryridePDX@gmail.com).
