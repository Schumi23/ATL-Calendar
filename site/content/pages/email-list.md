## About 

In addition to our [ride calendar](/calendar/), Shift also manages an [email discussion list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/shift). The Shift list is a great place to talk about all things bike-y: promote your ride, scheme about [Pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza/), get advice on bike routes, warn people about hazards to bike fun, or anything else bike-adjacent.

## Join

The list is open to anyone who is from or interested in biking in Portland. [Sign up](https://lists.riseup.net/www/subscribe/shift) on our list host RiseUp.net and you're good to go. Just mind our [Code of Conduct](/pages/shift-code-of-conduct/)!

## Posting

Once subscribed, you can receive the list via email or view it on the web. You can also get each message delivered individually as they come, or as a daily digest. To start a new thread, [send an email to the list](mailto:shift@lists.riseup.net) with a new subject. 

To read about bike fun past and get inspired for the future, [browse the archives](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/shift) — over 20 years of bike discussions!

## Contact

For help with subscriptions or any questions about the list, please [email list admins](mailto:shift-admin@lists.riseup.net).
