## Our mission

<p class="mission-statement" style="text-align: center; padding: 1em; color: #663300; border: 1px solid #FFDD66; background: #FCFAF2; font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;"><strong>Shiftâ€™s mission is to promote inclusive bike fun.</strong></p>

As a loose-knit and informal bunch of bike-loving folks, we ask for no membership, nor dues, only a shared passion for the bicycle in all its glory: as toy, as transportation, as a tool for social and environmental change!

Shift, then, is open to everyone sharing in this passion.

And where would the fun be if we weren't at least semi-organized?! Yes, Shift folks do plan, execute, publicize, and get involved in the celebration of bicycle events. We hope you'll be inspired to join in on the bike fun too!

## Our history



We stole all this from Shift2bikes and are playing around with the website
